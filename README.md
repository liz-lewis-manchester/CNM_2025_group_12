# Model of Pollutant Transport in a river

## Task Description 
This coursework involves developing a Python-based numerical model to simulate the transport of pollutant in a river over time and space.

The objective was to implement a 1-dimensional advection model that computes pollutant concentration as a function of distance and time downstream. The model solves the advection equation using finite difference methods in both the spatial and temporal domains. 

The project integrates programming, numerical modelling, data handling, testing, visualisation and collaborative software development using GitHub.

## Mathematical Model
Pollutant transport modelled using the 1-dimentional advection equation:

dC/dt + U dC/dx = 0 
where:
- C is pollutant concentration
- t is time
- x is distance along the river
- U is stream velocity

The equation is discretised with the finite difference methods in time and space for numerical simulation.
